# Understanding Data Structures with a Treasure Hunt Game!

Hi everyone! In this article, I'm going to explain data structures with a treasure hunt game! So, for all the beginners, who have just stepped into Computer Science, this is what you can find interesting!
Do you love solving puzzles in order to find treasure or in escape room games? If yes, you're in the right place! So, I'll give you a bunch of tasks where you can assume and co-relate the situations here with data structures in Computer Science. Basically, the logic which we use to solve a puzzle in treasure hunt, is here corresponding to Algorithms in Computer Science. The structural idea of that scenario in game corresponds to data structures here in Computer Science!


I'll go with a scenario, imagine yourself as a adventurer. You found a book in your shelf, named as "Come, adventures ahead!". You opened it and there you found a map which leads to an unlimited treasure. Now, you have started your adventure with an eye on the treasure map. So, what kind of information can you retreive by looking at maps? You can see the location of treasure, shortest way to reach it, number of ways you can go through, and so on. Here, Graphs in Computer Science seems like the same! A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

You got the information which has route to the treasure and you can calculate shortest paths with algorithms using graphs. Now, you got confused with the two different paths i.e left, and right. You can look and make a plan with every possible direction in every junction point using trees. A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.

Various types of trees have been developed throughout the past decades, in order to suit certain applications and meet certain constraints. Some examples are binary search tree, B tree, treap, red-black tree, splay tree, AVL tree and n-ary tree.
Now, it's time to solve a really difficult task which even took a lot of time for scientists in ancient days. The problem is so called 'Towers of Hanoi'. It is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any poles. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole (say ‘source pole’) to another pole (say ‘destination pole’) with the help of the third pole (say auxiliary pole).
The puzzle has the following two rules:
1. You can’t place a larger disk onto a smaller disk 
2. Only one disk can be moved at a time

If you start solving this problem, it would take many years to complete. However, we can solve it by recursive methods using stacks. A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out - the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “stack” because it resembles a real-world stack - a stack of plates.
After solving Towers of Hanoi, you are appreciated and given a secret code saying " Open the 105 door in House of 1000 doors". Now, with a bit of common sense, we can easily enter the room 105 since all the rooms are indexed with room numbers. This is how array of elements used. An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

In the room 105, you found some artifacts and clues. You're advised to store them in your backpack for futher purposes. The room leads to a bridge where only 10 people can be on the bridge. So, In case of 11th member to step on to the bridge, the very first one should step out to the other side of the bridge. This is how Queue data structure works! A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out - the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue - people waiting in a queue.
Now, it's time to use the things you've collected! There are the sequence of tasks and you need to use the appropriate item depending on the scenario. For Example, there's a pen with an eagle shaped edge. We can open the door which needs eagle shaped item inserted to unlock. Thereby, we can open the door and unlock other clues which can be used in further tasks. This seem each task is linked to another right? This is how linked list works! A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.

Finally, you've reached the end!! However, you're supposed to find a room where treasure is hidden. You're provided with some codes from which you've to find a key. Now, you're supposed to find the room that can be opened with this key. This seems similar like Hash Tables in Computer Science. A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting and searching, irrespective of the size of the data. Direct Addressing uses the one-to-one mapping between the values and keys when storing in a table. However, there is a problem with this approach when there is a large number of key-value pairs. The table will be huge with so many records and may be impractical or even impossible to be stored, given the memory available on a typical computer. To avoid this issue we use hash tables.

Congratulations!! You did it. I hope you understood data structures which are used in Computer Science.
